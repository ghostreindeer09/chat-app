# Python Chat Application Using Sockets

A real-time chat application built with Python, demonstrating client-server architecture, socket programming, and multithreading. The app supports user registration and login with password hashing, public and private messaging, chat history logging, and an optional GUI client built with Tkinter.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**  
  Register new users and login securely with SHA-256 password hashing.

- **Public & Private Messaging**  
  Send messages publicly to all connected users or privately using `/msg <username>`.

- **Chat History Logging**  
  All messages are saved to a log file, with the ability to retrieve full chat history via `/history`.

- **Multithreaded Server**  
  Handles multiple clients concurrently for real-time communication.

- **Optional GUI Client**  
  A Tkinter-based graphical client for an enhanced user experience.
